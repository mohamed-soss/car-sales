# Car Sales Dashboard Project

## Overview

This project features a comprehensive **Car Sales Dashboard** developed using Microsoft Power BI, designed to provide actionable insights into car sales performance across various dimensions. The dashboard was last updated on May 21, 2025, at 6:51 PM EEST, and serves as a powerful tool for business analysts, sales managers, and stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

The dashboard integrates multiple data sources to present a holistic view of sales metrics, including year-to-date (YTD) and month-to-date (MTD) sales figures, average prices, and sales distributions by body style, color, region, and company. It includes interactive filters and detailed data tables for in-depth analysis.

## Features

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard prominently displays the following KPIs at the top for a quick overview of sales performance:

- **YTD Total Sales**: $371.2M
- **MTD Total Sales**: $70.8M (with a 23.39% increase compared to the previous period)
- **YTD Average Price**: $28.0K (down by 0.79% from the previous period)
- **YTD Cars Sold**: 13.3K units
- **MTD Cars Sold**: 2.6K units (with a 24.57% increase compared to the previous period)

These metrics provide a snapshot of overall sales performance, highlighting both growth and areas of concern, such as the slight decline in average price.

### 2. Visualizations
The dashboard includes several visualizations to facilitate a deeper understanding of the data:

- **YTD Sales Weekly Trend**:
  - A line graph illustrating weekly sales trends over the year, with a peak reaching $14M.
  - This visualization helps identify seasonal patterns and sales fluctuations.

- **YTD Total Sales by Body Style**:
  - A donut chart categorizing sales by body style, including SUV, Hatchback, Sedan, Pickup, and Hardtop.
  - This breakdown allows stakeholders to understand which vehicle types are driving the most revenue.

- **YTD Total Sales by Color**:
  - A donut chart showing the distribution of sales by color, specifically Pale White, Black, and Red.
  - This visualization highlights customer color preferences, which can inform inventory decisions.

- **YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region**:
  - A geographical map of the United States, with bubbles representing sales volume in key regions such as Plano, Aurora, Scottsdale, and others.
  - This map enables regional performance analysis, identifying high-performing and underperforming areas.

- **Company-wise Sales Trend**:
  - A detailed table comparing sales metrics across multiple companies, including Acura, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chrysler, and Ford. The table includes:
    - **YTD Average Price**: Ranges from $28.7K (Ford) to $29.4K (Acura).
    - **YTD Cars Sold**: Ranges from 370 units (Acura) to 886 units (Ford).
    - **YTD Total Sales**: Ranges from $19.3M (Acura) to $25.4M (Ford).
    - **% YTD Total Sales**: Contribution to overall sales, with Ford at 6.7% and Acura at 2.5%.
  - This comparison helps benchmark performance across brands and identify market leaders.

### 3. Interactive Filters
The dashboard includes a robust filtering system on the left-hand side, allowing users to drill down into specific subsets of the data:

- **Body Style**: Filter by SUV, Hatchback, Sedan, Pickup, Hardtop, or All.
- **Dealer Name**: Select specific dealers to analyze their performance.
- **Transmission**: Filter by transmission type (e.g., Automatic, Manual, or All).
- **Engine**: Filter by engine type (e.g., specific engine configurations or All).

These filters enable dynamic exploration of the data, allowing users to focus on specific segments of interest.

### 4. Detailed Data Table (Details Page)
The "Details" tab provides a granular view of the data in a tabular format, with the following columns:

- **Car ID**: Unique identifier for each car (e.g., CND_000001).
- **Date**: Transaction date (e.g., January 02, 2022).
- **Customer Name**: Name of the buyer (e.g., Geraldine, Gia).
- **Dealer Name**: Name of the dealership (e.g., Buddy Storbeckâ€™s Diesel Service Inc, C & M Motors Inc).
- **Company**: Car manufacturer (e.g., Ford, Cadillac, Toyota).
- **Color**: Car color (e.g., Black, Red, Pale White).
- **Model**: Car model (e.g., Expedition, Eldorado, Celica).
- **Total Sales**: Sale amount for each transaction (e.g., $26.0K, $51.5K).

This table allows for detailed record-level analysis, supporting use cases such as auditing, customer profiling, and sales tracking.
